# 432 Spring 2019 Materials After the Final Class

Here is where I'll be posting information after our final class meeting. I wish you all the best of luck in the rest of the class and in the rest of your life.

## Quiz 2

All Quiz 2 information and materials [are located here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/tree/master/quizzes/quiz2). The answer sketch [is now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-432/blob/master/quizzes/quiz2/quiz2_2019_with_sketch.pdf). On 2019-05-06, you should have received an email from Professor Love containing your grades on each of the 36 items.

## On R 3.6.0

R 3.6.0 is now available, or soon will be, for your machine. I strongly recommend that you NOT upgrade until after you have completed Quiz 2. The reason is that as of R 3.6 the random number generator will use a different (admittedly better, but still, different) default algorithm. Thus, functions like `sample()` will give different results with the same seed being set. If you upgrade before finishing your project, that's your choice, but I probably wouldn't.

## On R Studio 1.2

R Studio 1.2 [was released on 2019-04-30](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/04/30/rstudio-1-2-release/). It's got lots of excellent new features, but if you're currently using 1.1, then I suggest you wait to install 1.2 until after you complete Quiz 2 and your project for the course.

## Project 2
