# Homework assignments for 432 in Fall 2019

### We take deadlines VERY seriously.

This is graduate school. Take the deadlines very seriously. Late homework receives a severe penalty, because we post answer sketches as quickly as possible after the deadline of each assignment. Not turning in a homework is absolutely disastrous. Always, always, always turn in your work, on time.

## Grading

Homework assignments are graded by the teaching assistants, using a rubric and answer sketch developed together with Dr. Love. We aim to return your grade on each homework to you within 7 days of the assignment's deadline. Each Homework assignment is weighted equally in determining your final Homework grade in the course.

### Grading Errors

In grading, we occasionally make errors.

- If you believe we have simply added up your points on a homework assignment incorrectly, please email Dr. Love directly to describe your concern. You can do this at any time before May 1.
- We do not address more substantial regrade requests on homework assignments until May. Should you wish to request a regrade that isn't just mis-adding up your points on a homework, [fill out this form](http://bit.ly/432-2019-regrades) at http://bit.ly/432-2019-regrades at any time before 2 PM on May 7. Dr. Love will review all such requests in a batch immediately after that deadline.
- The teaching assistants will be happy to discuss any homework with you after it is complete, and try to help you understand in more detail how you went wrong. However, protesting your grade to them is pointless, as such protests should be directed only to Dr. Love. Thank you.
