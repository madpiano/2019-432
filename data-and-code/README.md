# Data and Code for 432, Spring 2018

- [Here are the R Packages you should install](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018/blob/master/data-and-code/PACKAGES.MD) for this class. The list will be updated occasionally as the semester progresses.
    - I recommend you upgrade to R version 3.4.3 (or higher) and to R Studio version 1.1.383 (or higher).
    - If you need complete instructions for installing R and R Studio, refer to the [software installation materials from 431](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431/blob/master/software-installation-431.md).
- Hadley Wickham's [Whole Game Video](https://youtu.be/go5Au01Jrvs) with [code and data here](https://github.com/hadley/building-permits) may be of interest. Hadley does a nice job of showing you how people actually do data analysis work.
